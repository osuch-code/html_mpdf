HTML to mPDF sample files
## Introduction
Sample files used to start working with mPDF.
## Installation
Get mPDF from https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf.


After installation change the path in the sample files to point to the installation.

Have added a Polish section of text to ensure all works as expected.

Apart from that - good to go.
