<h1>The Art &amp; Work of Cyprian Norwid</h1>
<p>Cyprian Kamil Norwid was a Polish writer (1821-1883).</p>

<h2>Poet, Writer, Artist</h2>
<p>His work, rediscovered today, provides an insight into the mind of an artist trying to make sense of the world in his unique way - through his religion, upbringing, language and history.</p>

<p>Having his work read by future generations was one of his hopes.</p>

<h2>Give Me That Sky-Blue Ribbon</h2>

<p><em>Translation - Jerzy Peterkiewicz</em></p>

<p>Give me that sky-blue ribbon, you’ll get it back</p>
<p>Entire, and undelayed…</p>
<p>Or else give me the shadow of your neck:</p>
<p>But no! I want no shade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A shade will change when your hand beckons me,</p>
<p>For shadows do not sham.</p>
<p>No, I want nothing from you, pretty lady.</p>
<p>I take away my arm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God usually rewards with lesser things,</p>
<p>Such as a drop of rain,</p>
<p>A fallen leaf that obstinately clings,</p>
<p>Stuck to the window-pane.</p>
<p></p>
